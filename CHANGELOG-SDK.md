- `getVersion()` - Get specific historical version
- `getHistory()` - Get complete version history
- `list()` - Filter and list entries by type or userId
- `search()` - Full-text search across immutable entries
- `count()` - Count entries with filters
- `purge()` - Delete entry and all versions (GDPR)

#### Enhanced Testing
- 45 comprehensive tests for immutable store (100% passing)
- State change propagation tests (8 total)
- Edge case tests for scale (10 total) 
- Cross-operation integration tests (7 total)
- Interactive test runner updated with 11 immutable options

### Changed

- **Package name**: Renamed from `@cortexmemory/cortex-sdk` to `@cortexmemory/sdk`
