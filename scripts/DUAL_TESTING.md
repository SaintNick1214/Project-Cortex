# Dual Testing Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified âœ…

**Original Issue:** Unreachable dead code in `tests/env.ts` (lines 38-46)

When `testMode === 'auto'` and **both** `hasLocalConfig` and `hasManagedConfig` were true:

1. First condition (line 28): `testMode === "auto" && hasLocalConfig && !hasManagedConfig`
   - Result: **FALSE** (because `!hasManagedConfig` is false)
2. Second condition (line 35): `testMode === "auto" && hasManagedConfig`
   - Result: **TRUE** âœ… (matches and executes)
3. Third condition (line 39): `testMode === "auto" && hasLocalConfig`
   - Result: **NEVER REACHED** (dead code)

**Consequence:** When both configs were present, the system defaulted to **MANAGED** instead of running both test suites, contradicting the stated goal of dual testing.

## Solution Implemented âœ…

### 1. Created Smart Test Runner (`scripts/test-runner.mjs`)

A new orchestration script that:

- Detects available Convex configurations (local and/or managed)
- Automatically runs appropriate test suite(s) based on availability:
  - **Local only** â†’ runs local tests
  - **Managed only** â†’ runs managed tests
  - **Both present** â†’ runs **BOTH** test suites sequentially
- Respects explicit `CONVEX_TEST_MODE` overrides
- Provides clear console output showing which tests are running
- Exits with proper error codes for CI/CD integration

### 2. Updated Package.json

Changed the default `test` command from:

```json
"test": "node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js --testPathIgnorePatterns=debug --runInBand"
```

To:

```json
"test": "node scripts/test-runner.mjs"
```

This makes `npm test` automatically use the smart dual testing behavior.

### 3. Simplified `tests/env.ts`

Restructured the conditional logic to:

- Remove all unreachable code paths
- Handle each mode explicitly (local, managed, auto)
- Provide clear warnings if both configs are detected in auto mode when run directly
- Direct users to use `npm test` for proper dual testing

**Key fix:** The auto mode now has clear, reachable branches for:

- Local only
- Managed only
- Both (with warning to use test runner)

### 4. Updated Documentation (`tests/README.md`)

Updated the testing guide to clearly explain:

- Smart dual testing behavior of `npm test`
- When both configs are present, both test suites run automatically
- Relationship between `npm test` and `npm run test:both`

## Verification âœ…

The solution now correctly implements the dual testing strategy:

| Scenario                  | Expected Behavior    | Implementation                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Only local vars present   | Run local tests      | âœ… test-runner.mjs detects and runs local   |
| Only managed vars present | Run managed tests    | âœ… test-runner.mjs detects and runs managed |
| Both vars present         | Run BOTH test suites | âœ… test-runner.mjs runs local then managed  |
| Explicit mode set         | Run specified mode   | âœ… Honors CONVEX_TEST_MODE override         |

## No More Dead Code âœ…

All conditional branches in `tests/env.ts` are now reachable:

- âœ… `testMode === "local"` - explicit local mode
- âœ… `testMode === "managed"` - explicit managed mode
- âœ… `testMode === "auto" && hasLocalConfig && !hasManagedConfig` - local only
- âœ… `testMode === "auto" && hasManagedConfig && !hasLocalConfig` - managed only
- âœ… `testMode === "auto" && hasLocalConfig && hasManagedConfig` - both present (with warning)

## Usage Examples

### Developer with only local setup:

```bash
npm test  # Automatically runs local tests only
```

### Developer with only managed setup:

```bash
npm test  # Automatically runs managed tests only
```

### Developer with both setups (most common in CI/CD):

```bash
npm test  # Automatically runs BOTH test suites
# Output:
# ðŸš€ Running LOCAL tests...
# âœ… LOCAL tests completed successfully
# ðŸš€ Running MANAGED tests...
# âœ… MANAGED tests completed successfully
# ðŸŽ‰ SUCCESS: All test suites passed!
```

### Explicit mode selection (still supported):

```bash
npm run test:local     # Force local only
npm run test:managed   # Force managed only
npm run test:both      # Explicit both (same as npm test with both configs)
```

## Files Changed

1. âœ… `scripts/test-runner.mjs` - **NEW** - Smart test orchestration
2. âœ… `package.json` - Updated default test command
3. âœ… `tests/env.ts` - Fixed unreachable code, simplified logic
4. âœ… `tests/README.md` - Updated documentation

## Result

The dual testing system now works exactly as intended:

- âœ… No dead code
- âœ… Automatic detection of available configs
- âœ… Runs all available test suites when both are present
- âœ… Clear, maintainable code structure
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation
