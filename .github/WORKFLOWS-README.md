# GitHub Workflows - Cortex SDK

This directory contains automated CI/CD workflows for the Cortex SDK.

---

## üìã Available Workflows

### publish.yml - Automated npm Publishing

**Trigger**: Automatic when `package.json` version changes on `main` branch

**What it does**:
1. ‚úÖ Detects version changes
2. ‚úÖ Runs all 201 tests
3. ‚úÖ Builds package
4. ‚úÖ Publishes to npm
5. ‚úÖ Creates git tag
6. ‚úÖ Creates GitHub release
7. ‚úÖ Verifies publish

**Required Secrets**:
- `NPM_TOKEN` (required) - npm authentication token
- `CONVEX_URL` (optional) - for running tests in CI

**Setup**: See [SETUP-AUTOMATED-RELEASES.md](./SETUP-AUTOMATED-RELEASES.md)

## üöÄ How to Use

### Automated Release (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Update version
# package.json: "version": "0.5.0"

# 2. Update changelog
# CHANGELOG.md: Add v0.5.0 section

# 3. Commit and push
git add package.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: release v0.5.0"
git push origin main

# 4. GitHub Action publishes automatically!
# Watch: https://github.com/SaintNick1214/Project-Cortex/actions
```

### Manual Release (Alternative)

```bash
# For beta releases or quick hotfixes
npm run release

# Interactive script with manual confirmation
```

## üîê Security

**Secrets are stored securely**:
- Managed in GitHub repository settings
- Never exposed in logs
- Scoped to specific workflows
- Rotatable anytime

**Provenance enabled**:
- npm packages include signed provenance
- Verifiable build attestation
- Enhanced supply chain security

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Workflow doesn't trigger

**Check**:
- Did you push to `main` branch?
- Did `package.json` version actually change?
- Is the commit on `main` (not other branch)?

### Tests fail in CI

**Check**:
- Do tests pass locally? (`npm test`)
- Is `CONVEX_URL` secret configured?
- Is Convex deployment accessible?

### Publish fails

**Check**:
- Is `NPM_TOKEN` secret configured correctly?
- Is the token still valid? (npm tokens can expire)
- Does the package name already exist at this version?

### Git tag fails

**Check**:
- Does tag already exist? (`git tag -l`)
- Are there git permission issues?

## üìù Workflow Files

| File | Purpose | Trigger |
|------|---------|---------|
| `publish.yml` | Automated npm publish | Version change on main |

**Future workflows** (planned):
- `test.yml` - Run tests on all PRs
- `lint.yml` - Code quality checks
- `docs.yml` - Deploy documentation
- `security.yml` - Security scanning

## üéØ Best Practices

### Version Bumping

```bash
# Major release (breaking changes)
"0.4.0" ‚Üí "1.0.0"

# Minor release (new features)
"0.4.0" ‚Üí "0.5.0"

# Patch release (bug fixes)
"0.4.0" ‚Üí "0.4.1"

# Beta/alpha
"0.5.0-beta.1" ‚Üí "0.5.0-beta.2"
```

### Commit Messages

```bash
# Triggers automated release
git commit -m "chore: release v0.5.0"

# Describes what's in the release
git commit -m "feat: Layer 3 Memory API complete (v0.5.0)"

# Clear and consistent
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.5.0"
```

### Testing Before Release

```bash
# Always test locally first
npm test

# Run interactive tests
npm run test:interactive

# Check build
npm run build

# Verify package contents
npm pack --dry-run
```
