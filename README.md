## 🎯 The Vision

Cortex brings enterprise-grade persistent memory to any AI agent system. Built on Convex, it provides flexible, scalable memory that works with any LLM or framework.

**The Problem We're Solving:**

Traditional memory solutions force you to choose between vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate) or simple storage (Redis), manage complex infrastructure, write custom multi-agent coordination logic, and handle user profiles separately. It's fragmented, complex, and time-consuming.

**The Cortex Solution:**

A unified memory system that gives you everything in one package - production-ready memory that scales automatically, works with any LLM framework, supports any embedding provider, and requires zero infrastructure management.

## ✨ Features

Cortex provides a complete memory system for AI agents:

- 🧠 **Flexible Memory** - Remember anything without hardcoded topics or schemas ✅
- 🔒 **Memory Space Isolation** - Flexible boundaries (per user, team, or project) ✅
- ♾️ **Long-term Persistence** - Memories last forever with automatic indexing ✅
- ⏱️ **Automatic Versioning** - Updates preserve history, never lose data (10 versions default) ✅
- 🗄️ **ACID + Vector Hybrid** - Immutable conversation source + fast searchable index ✅
- 🔍 **Semantic Search** - AI-powered retrieval with multi-strategy fallback ✅
- 📊 **Vector Embeddings** - Optional but preferred, support any dimension (768, 1536, 3072+) ✅
- 🔗 **Context Chains** - Hierarchical context sharing across memory spaces ✅
- 👥 **User Profiles** - Rich user context with GDPR cascade deletion ✅
- 📈 **Access Analytics** - Built-in statistics and insights ✅
- 🎯 **Agent Registry** - Optional metadata for discovery and cascade cleanup ✅
- 🚀 **Embedding Agnostic** - Works with OpenAI, Cohere, local models, or any provider ✅
- 🕸️ **Graph Database Integration** - Neo4j/Memgraph support with orphan detection ✅
- 🧠 **Fact Extraction** - LLM-powered fact extraction for 60-90% storage savings ✅
- 🔌 **MCP Server** - Cross-application memory sharing (planned)
- 💬 **A2A Communication** - Inter-space messaging helpers (planned)

## ✨ What's New in v0.8.0

### Users & Agents APIs - GDPR Compliance & Cascade Deletion

Complete implementation of coordination layer APIs with powerful cascade deletion:

**Users API (`cortex.users.*`)** - GDPR Compliance
- User profile management with automatic versioning
- **GDPR cascade deletion by userId** across all layers
- Works in free SDK (DIY graph) and Cloud Mode (managed + legal guarantees)
- Deletes from: conversations, immutable, mutable, vector, facts, graph
- Transaction-like rollback on failures
- 23/23 tests passing on LOCAL and MANAGED

**Agents API (`cortex.agents.*`)** - Optional Registry
- Optional metadata registration for discovery and analytics
- **Cascade deletion by participantId** across all memory spaces
- Works even if agent was never registered
- Deletes from: conversations, memories, facts, graph
- Graph orphan detection included
- 20/20 tests passing on LOCAL and MANAGED

```typescript
// GDPR cascade deletion by userId
await cortex.users.delete("user-123", { 
  cascade: true,  // Deletes across ALL layers
  verify: true    // Checks for orphaned records
});

// Agent cleanup by participantId
await cortex.agents.unregister("agent-xyz", {
  cascade: true,  // Deletes across ALL memory spaces
  verify: true    // Includes graph orphan detection
});
```

## ✨ What's New in v0.7.0

### Graph Database Integration

Add powerful graph database capabilities to Cortex for advanced relationship queries:

```typescript
import { Cortex } from "@cortexmemory/sdk";
import { CypherGraphAdapter, initializeGraphSchema } from "@cortexmemory/sdk/graph";

// Setup graph database
const graph = new CypherGraphAdapter();
await graph.connect({ uri: "bolt://localhost:7687", ... });
await initializeGraphSchema(graph);

// Initialize Cortex with graph
const cortex = new Cortex({
  convexUrl: process.env.CONVEX_URL!,
  graph: { adapter: graph }
});

// Use normally - auto-syncs to graph!
await cortex.memory.remember({
  memorySpaceId: "agent-1",
  conversationId: "conv-123",
  userMessage: "Alice works at Acme Corp using TypeScript",
  agentResponse: "Got it!",
  userId: "alice",
  userName: "Alice"
});

// Graph enrichment provides 2-5x more context:
// - Discovers entity relationships (Alice knows Bob, Bob uses TypeScript)
// - Reconstructs full context chains (parent-child workflows)
// - Traces provenance (memory → conversation → context → user)
// - Enables multi-hop knowledge discovery
```

**When to use:**
- Deep context chains (5+ levels)
- Knowledge graphs with entity relationships
- Multi-hop reasoning (Alice → Company → Bob → Technology)
- Provenance tracking and audit trails
- Complex multi-agent coordination

**Performance:** 3.8x faster for deep traversals, <100ms enrichment overhead

See [Graph Database Setup Guide](./Documentation/07-advanced-topics/05-graph-database-setup.md) for quick start!

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Cortex is built on the shoulders of giants:

- [Convex](https://convex.dev) - The reactive backend platform powering Cortex
- [Project Constellation](https://github.com/SaintNick1214/constellation) - The original inspiration for this system
- The open source AI community - For pushing the boundaries of what's possible

## 🎯 Origin Story

Cortex was born out of building [Project Constellation](https://github.com/SaintNick1214/constellation), an enterprise multi-agent AI system for Microsoft Teams. While building Constellation, we realized the memory system we needed didn't exist - so we're extracting and open-sourcing it as Cortex.

**What makes Cortex different:**

- Designed for real-world production use (not a prototype)
- Battle-tested patterns from building multi-agent systems
- Built by developers who needed it, for developers who need it
- Focus on developer experience and simplicity
