### [0.4.0] - 2025-10-26

#### ðŸŽ‰ Major Release - Vector Memory (Layer 2)!

Complete semantic search and vector memory implementation! **All 14 Layer 2 operations.**

#### Added

**Vector Memory API (Layer 2)** - ALL 14 operations:

**Core Operations (6)**:

- `store()` - Store agent-private memories with optional embeddings
- `get()` - Retrieve memory by ID with agent isolation
- `search()` - Hybrid search (semantic with vectors OR keyword without)
- `delete()` - Delete memories with permission checks
- `list()` - List memories with filters (sourceType, userId)
- `count()` - Count memories

**Advanced Operations (5)**:

- `update()` - Update memory content/metadata (creates versions)
- `getVersion()` - Retrieve specific version
- `getHistory()` - Get complete version history
- `deleteMany()` - Bulk delete with filters
- `export()` - Export to JSON/CSV for GDPR

**Optional Operations (3)**:

- `updateMany()` - Bulk update importance/tags
- `archive()` - Soft delete (restorable)
- `getAtTimestamp()` - Temporal queries (time-travel)

#### Features

**Semantic Search**:

- Bring your own embeddings (OpenAI, Cohere, local, etc.)
- Optional embeddings (keyword search works without)
- Hybrid search capability (vector + text)
- Support 384-3072 dimensions

**Agent Isolation**:

- Private memory per agent
- Permission checks on all operations
- No cross-agent data leakage

**Layer 1 Integration**:

- Reference conversations (conversationRef)
- Reference immutable knowledge (immutableRef)
- Reference mutable data (mutableRef)
- Standalone memories (no ref)

**Versioning**:

- Like immutable, updates create versions
- Version history accessible
- Temporal queries (what was it on X date)

#### Enhanced Testing

- +33 tests for Layer 2 (33/33 passing)
- Agent isolation validated
- Hybrid search tested
- Versioning validated
- Bulk operations tested
- **Total tests**: 201 (69 + 54 + 45 + 33)

**Total**: 54 operations, 201 tests, 100% passing

### [0.3.1] - 2025-10-26

#### ðŸŽŠ Patch Release - 100% Layer 1 Complete!

Adds `transaction()` - the final missing operation! **All 40 documented Layer 1 operations now implemented.**

#### Added

- `transaction()` - ACID multi-key transactions for mutable store
  - Execute multiple operations atomically (all succeed or all fail)
  - Supports: set, update, delete, increment, decrement
  - Perfect for inventory transfers, order processing, etc.

#### Enhanced Testing

- +6 transaction tests (atomicity, mixed operations, transfers, integration)
- +2 cross-layer integration tests
- **Total tests**: 168 (69 conversations + 54 immutable + 45 mutable)

**Status**: âœ… **100% of documented Layer 1 operations implemented!** (40/40)

- `purgeMany()` - Bulk delete entries with filters
- `purgeVersions()` - Version retention enforcement (keep latest N)

**Mutable Store Complete (Layer 1c)**:

- `set()`, `get()`, `update()`, `delete()` - Core CRUD

## Project History

### [0.1.0-alpha] - 2025-10-23

### Added

- Initial alpha release
- Core memory operations (store, retrieve, search, delete, update)
- **Automatic memory versioning** - Updates preserve history (default: 10 versions)
- **Temporal queries** - Query memory state at any point in time
- **Timestamps on all memories** - createdAt, updatedAt, lastAccessed
- Hybrid agent management system (simple IDs + optional registry)
- User profile management
- Context chain support for hierarchical agent coordination
- Vector search with flexible dimensions (768, 1536, 3072+)
- Multi-strategy search retrieval (semantic + keyword + fallback)
- Access analytics and tracking
- Embedding-agnostic architecture
- TypeScript support with full type definitions
- Comprehensive documentation structure
- Code of Conduct and Contributing guidelines
- Security policy and reporting procedures
- Apache License 2.0

### Architecture Decisions

- Built on Convex backend for optimal performance
- **ACID + Vector Hybrid**: Immutable conversation history + searchable memory index with conversationRef links
- Two-tier model: Direct mode (open source) + Cloud mode (managed service)
- Developer brings their own embeddings (optional, embedding-agnostic)
- Progressive enhancement: raw content â†’ embeddings â†’ summarization
- Support for any Convex deployment (Cloud, localhost, self-hosted)
- conversationRef preserves full context even after vector retention cleanup

### Known Limitations

- Alpha stability - API may change
- Limited integration examples (more coming in beta)
- No CLI tools yet
- Documentation in progress
- No official support channels yet

### Breaking Changes

- N/A (initial release)
