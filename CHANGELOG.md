## Project History

### [0.1.0-alpha] - 2025-10-23

### Added

- Initial alpha release
- Core memory operations (store, retrieve, search, delete, update)
- **Automatic memory versioning** - Updates preserve history (default: 10 versions)
- **Temporal queries** - Query memory state at any point in time
- **Timestamps on all memories** - createdAt, updatedAt, lastAccessed
- Hybrid agent management system (simple IDs + optional registry)
- User profile management
- Context chain support for hierarchical agent coordination
- Vector search with flexible dimensions (768, 1536, 3072+)
- Multi-strategy search retrieval (semantic + keyword + fallback)
- Access analytics and tracking
- Embedding-agnostic architecture
- TypeScript support with full type definitions
- Comprehensive documentation structure
- Code of Conduct and Contributing guidelines
- Security policy and reporting procedures
- Apache License 2.0

### Architecture Decisions

- Built on Convex backend for optimal performance
- **ACID + Vector Hybrid**: Immutable conversation history + searchable memory index with conversationRef links
- Two-tier model: Direct mode (open source) + Cloud mode (managed service)
- Developer brings their own embeddings (optional, embedding-agnostic)
- Progressive enhancement: raw content â†’ embeddings â†’ summarization
- Support for any Convex deployment (Cloud, localhost, self-hosted)
- conversationRef preserves full context even after vector retention cleanup

### Known Limitations

- Alpha stability - API may change
- Limited integration examples (more coming in beta)
- No CLI tools yet
- Documentation in progress
- No official support channels yet

### Breaking Changes

- N/A (initial release)
