## SDK Releases

### [0.5.1] - 2025-10-27

#### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes & Testing Improvements

Six critical bugs identified through comprehensive testing and agent review, all verified and fixed.

#### Fixed

**Critical Performance & Correctness Issues**:

1. **Vector Search Local/Managed Fallback** - Added proper try/catch fallback for local Convex deployments
   - Local Convex doesn't support `.similar()` API (verified via Context7 documentation lookup)
   - Now gracefully falls back to manual cosine similarity in local dev
   - Production/managed deployments use optimized database vector indexing
   - Eliminates `TypeError: r.similar is not a function` errors

2. **Environment Variable Loading Order** - Fixed precedence for test configuration
   - Split `setup.ts` into `env.ts` (loads first) and `setup.ts` (hooks only)
   - Changed Jest config to use `setupFiles` for environment (before modules load)
   - Reversed order: `.env.test` first, `.env.local` second with `override: true`
   - Now local settings properly override test defaults AND system environment variables

3. **Cosine Similarity Dimension Validation** - Fixed mathematically incorrect similarity scores
   - Previously used `Math.min()` to handle mismatched dimensions (WRONG)
   - Example: 1536-dim query vs 768-dim stored only compared 768 dims, producing incorrect scores
   - Now validates dimensions match before calculating similarity
   - Filters out mismatched embeddings with clear -1 score marker

4. **purgeAll Security Vulnerability** - Added environment checks to prevent production misuse
   - Was completely unprotected - anyone could delete ALL memories
   - Violated agent isolation principle used throughout codebase
   - Now checks: `CONVEX_SITE_URL`, `NODE_ENV`, `CONVEX_ENVIRONMENT`
   - Allows: localhost, 127.0.0.1, .convex.site, .convex.cloud (dev), test environments
   - Blocks: Production deployments with clear error message

**Test Quality Improvements**:

5. **Semantic Search Test Validation** - Strengthened test to validate ranking quality
   - Previously used `.find()` to match ANY result (could match low-ranked results)
   - Now validates `results[0]` (top-ranked result) contains expected content
   - Ensures semantic search returns MOST relevant result first
   - Better debugging output shows all top results with match indicators

6. **Test Cleanup Fragility** - Eliminated hardcoded agent ID maintenance burden
   - Consolidated duplicate cleanup logic into shared `TestCleanup` helper
   - Added `purgeMemories()` method using new `memories.purgeAll` mutation
   - Removed hardcoded agent ID lists (was fragile, required maintenance)
   - Now purges ALL memories regardless of agent ID (safe for test environments)
   - Future-proof: new tests with any agent ID automatically cleaned

#### Added

**Dual Testing Strategy**:

- **New test modes**: `test:local`, `test:managed`, `test:both` npm scripts
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically selects deployment based on environment variables
- **Environment support**:
  - `LOCAL_CONVEX_URL` for local Convex dev server testing
  - `CONVEX_URL` + `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` for managed deployment testing
  - `CONVEX_TEST_MODE` to manually override auto-detection
- **Deployment type tracking**: `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT_TYPE` env var for test-specific behavior

**New Files**:

- `tests/env.ts` - Environment loading with dual testing strategy support
- `tests/README.md` - Comprehensive testing guide with dual strategy documentation
- `dev-docs/DUAL-TESTING-STRATEGY.md` - Technical implementation details
- `dev-docs/BUG-FIXES-SUMMARY.md` - Complete bug fix report
- `scripts/cleanup-test-data.ts` - Manual cleanup utility for test environments

**New Backend Mutations**:

- `memories.purgeAll` - Test-only mutation to delete all memories (environment-protected)

#### Changed

**Test Infrastructure**:

- Updated `TestCleanup` helper with `purgeMemories()` and `purgeAll()` methods
- Simplified `tests/setup.ts` to only contain test hooks
- Split Jest setup into `setupFiles` (env.ts) and `setupFilesAfterEnv` (setup.ts)
- Removed duplicate cleanup logic from `memory.test.ts` and `vector.test.ts`

**Documentation**:

- Updated `.env.test` with dual testing strategy examples
- Enhanced test validation with better error messages and debugging output

#### Technical Details

**Verification Methods**:

- Context7 documentation lookup confirmed local Convex limitations
- Comprehensive test validation across both deployment types
- 241/241 tests passing on both local and managed deployments

**Performance**:

- Local mode: ~28 seconds (manual cosine similarity)
- Managed mode: ~137 seconds (includes network latency to cloud)
- Both modes: 100% test coverage maintained
