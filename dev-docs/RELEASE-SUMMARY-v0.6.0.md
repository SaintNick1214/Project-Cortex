## üéØ Key Messages for Announcement

### Headline

**Cortex SDK v0.6.0: Revolutionary Memory Space Architecture with Hive Mode and Infinite Context**

### Elevator Pitch

v0.6.0 transforms AI agent memory with three breakthroughs:

1. **Hive Mode** - Multiple tools share one memory space (no duplication)
2. **Infinite Context** - Facts enable retrieval from 10,000+ messages
3. **Collaboration Mode** - Cross-organization secure sharing

### Key Stats

- **3 new APIs** (Facts, Contexts, Memory Spaces)
- **55+ new methods** across all APIs
- **378 tests, 100% passing** on both LOCAL and MANAGED
- **45,000 lines changed** in comprehensive refactor
- **50+ docs updated** with complete guides

### Breaking Change Summary

**Simple migration:** Rename `agentId` ‚Üí `memorySpaceId` everywhere. That's it for basic usage.

**Advanced migration:** Consolidate related agents into Hive spaces for zero duplication.
