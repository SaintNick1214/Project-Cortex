# Roadmap Overview

This section documents planned features and enhancements for Cortex. These pages help you understand future capabilities and plan your integrations accordingly.

<Callout type="info" title="Disclaimer">
  All features listed in this roadmap are **planned** but not yet implemented. Availability, specifications, and timelines are subject to change. We recommend using current features (see [Core Features](/core-features)) for production applications.
</Callout>

## Planned Features by Category

### Infrastructure & Services

<FeatureGrid columns={2}>
  <FeatureCard
    title="Cloud Mode"
    description="Managed services with auto-embeddings, GDPR compliance, and infrastructure"
    href="/roadmap/cloud-mode"

  <FeatureCard
    title="MCP Server"
    description="Cross-application memory via Model Context Protocol"
    href="/roadmap/mcp-server"
    icon="layers"
  />
</FeatureGrid>

**Cloud Mode** provides enterprise-ready managed services including automatic embeddings, GDPR-compliant cascade deletion, managed pub/sub infrastructure, analytics dashboards, and automatic governance enforcement. Your data stays in your Convex instance while Cortex Cloud handles operational complexity.

**MCP Server** enables memory sharing across AI tools like Cursor, Claude Desktop, and custom applications. Tell one tool something, all tools remember it.

### Core Capabilities

<FeatureGrid columns={3}>
  <FeatureCard
    title="Context Chains"
    description="Advanced workflow management capabilities"
    href="/roadmap/context-chains-enhancements"
    icon="git-branch"
    size="small"
  />
  <FeatureCard
    title="A2A Communication"
    description="Real-time subscriptions and smart routing"
    href="/roadmap/a2a-communication-enhancements"
    icon="message-circle"
    size="small"

  <FeatureCard
    title="Infinite Context"
    description="Advanced retrieval strategies"
    href="/roadmap/infinite-context-enhancements"
    icon="infinity"
    size="small"
  />
</FeatureGrid>

**Context Chains** enhancements include status transition validation, auto-complete parent contexts, automatic data inheritance, chain-wide participant propagation, and depth limit enforcement.

**A2A Communication** enhancements include real-time subscriptions via WebSocket, convenience inbox methods (`getInbox()`, `getSent()`, `markRead()`), Cloud Mode managed pub/sub, automated agent execution via webhooks, analytics dashboards, smart routing, and automated summarization.

**Infinite Context** enhancements include predictive pre-fetching, hierarchical retrieval (coarse-grained then fine-grained), cross-MemorySpace retrieval, adaptive fact extraction, automatic hybrid search, and content summarization.

### Platform & APIs

<FeatureGrid columns={3}>
  <FeatureCard
    title="API Enhancements"
    description="Bulk operations, filtering, and exports"
    href="/roadmap/api-enhancements"
    icon="code"
    size="small"
  />
  <FeatureCard
    title="Governance"
    description="Automatic policy enforcement"
    href="/roadmap/governance-enhancements"
    icon="shield"
    size="small"
  />
  <FeatureCard
    title="Access Analytics"
    description="Memory usage and performance analytics"
    href="/roadmap/access-analytics"
    icon="bar-chart"
    size="small"
  />
</FeatureGrid>

**API Enhancements** include dry-run modes for bulk operations, confirmation thresholds, advanced filtering (text search, nested queries, range operators), enhanced export capabilities (direct file writing, version history, linked conversations), multi-tenancy filters, and sessions API improvements.

**Governance** enhancements include automatic policy enforcement on every storage operation, automatic version purging, sessions policy enforcement, scheduled enforcement jobs, enforcement hooks, policy validation, and enforcement metrics.

**Access Analytics** provides the full `cortex.analytics.*` API with visual dashboards for memory growth, search performance, access heat maps, predictive analytics, cost tracking, and automated alerts.

## Feature Categories

### High Priority

Features that significantly improve developer experience or eliminate operational complexity:

- **Automatic Policy Enforcement** (Governance) - No more manual `enforce()` calls
- **Convenience Inbox Methods** (A2A) - `getInbox()`, `getSent()`, `markRead()`
- **Dry Run Mode** (API) - Preview bulk operations before executing
- **Status Transition Validation** (Context Chains) - Prevent invalid state changes
- **Automatic Hybrid Search** (Infinite Context) - Simplified semantic + keyword search

### Medium Priority

Features that add flexibility and power for advanced use cases:

- **Hierarchical Retrieval** (Infinite Context) - Scalability for large memory spaces
- **Smart Routing** (A2A) - AI-powered agent selection
- **Advanced Filtering** (API) - Nested queries, range operators
- **Automatic Data Inheritance** (Context Chains) - Simplified context chain data management

### Cloud Mode (Enterprise)

Enterprise features requiring managed infrastructure:

- **Auto-Embeddings** - Zero-config embedding generation
- **GDPR Cascade Deletion** - One-click compliance with legal guarantees
- **Managed Pub/Sub** - Real-time A2A without managing Redis/NATS
- **Analytics Dashboards** - Visual insights for memory, agents, and communication
- **Agent Billing & Limits** - Usage tracking and resource limits

---

## Migration Path

All planned features are designed to be **backward compatible**. Existing code will continue to work unchanged when new features are released.

### Example: Enabling Cloud Mode

```typescript
// Before (Direct Mode)
const cortex = new Cortex({
  convexUrl: process.env.CONVEX_URL!,
});

// After (Cloud Mode) - just add API key
const cortex = new Cortex({
  convexUrl: process.env.CONVEX_URL!,
  apiKey: "cortex_sk_...",
  mode: "cloud",
  autoEmbed: true, // Optional: automatic embeddings
});
```

### Example: Opting Into New Features

```typescript
// Existing code (works unchanged)
await cortex.contexts.update(spaceId, contextId, {
  status: "completed",
});

// New features (opt-in)
await cortex.contexts.update(spaceId, contextId, {
  status: "completed",
  validateTransition: true, // Opt-in to status validation
});
```
