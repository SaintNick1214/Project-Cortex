## Licensing Deep Dive

### GPL v3 (Neo4j Community)

**What it means:**

- Free to use
- Must open-source your application if you distribute it
- SaaS usage: Gray area (generally okay if not competing with Neo4j)
- For Cortex integration: Likely fine (user runs Neo4j, you provide integration code)

**Considerations:**

- If building commercial SaaS, consult legal
- If distributing product, may need Neo4j Enterprise license
- If building internal tools, GPL is usually fine

### BSL (Memgraph)

**What it means:**

- Source-available (can read code)
- Free for development, testing, evaluation
- Commercial use: Allowed for most cases
- Restrictions: Can't offer Memgraph "as a service"
- After 4 years, converts to Apache 2.0

**Considerations:**

- For Cortex: Fine (user runs Memgraph, not offering it as service)
- Safer than GPL for commercial products
- Check BSL terms if building competing product

### MIT (Kùzu)

**What it means:**

- Truly open source
- Use for anything (commercial, closed-source, etc.)
- No restrictions whatsoever
- Can embed in proprietary products

**Considerations:**

- Perfect for Apache 2.0 compliance
- If Kùzu matures, this becomes very attractive
- Currently: Limited by small community

### Proprietary (Neptune)

**What it means:**

- Managed service only
- Pay AWS for usage
- No self-hosting option
- No access to source code

**Considerations:**

- Vendor lock-in
- Ongoing costs
- But zero DevOps burden

## Cost Analysis

### Self-Hosted Neo4j

**Infrastructure:**

- Small: $20-40/month (2GB RAM, 20GB disk - DigitalOcean/AWS)
- Medium: $80-150/month (8GB RAM, 100GB disk - handles 1-5M nodes)
- Large: $300-500/month (32GB RAM, 500GB disk - handles 10-50M nodes)

**Dev Time:**

- Setup: 4-8 hours ($200-400 at $50/hr)
- Maintenance: 2-4 hours/month ($100-200/month)

**Total Year 1:**

- Small: ~$840 infra + $600 setup + $1,200-2,400 maintenance = ~$2,640-4,080
- Medium: ~$1,800 infra + $600 setup + $1,200-2,400 maintenance = ~$3,600-4,800

### Self-Hosted Memgraph

**Infrastructure:**

- Small: $40-60/month (4GB RAM minimum - Memgraph needs more RAM)
- Medium: $120-200/month (16GB RAM - for 1-5M nodes)
- Large: $400-600/month (64GB RAM - for 10-50M nodes)

**Dev Time:** Same as Neo4j

**Total Year 1:**

- Small: ~$1,080 infra + $600 setup + $1,200-2,400 maintenance = ~$2,880-4,080
- Medium: ~$2,400 infra + $600 setup + $1,200-2,400 maintenance = ~$4,200-5,400

**Note:** Memgraph requires more RAM, so infrastructure costs higher for same scale

### Cortex Graph-Premium (Cloud Mode)

**Pricing:**

- Scale tier add-on: $500/month
- Enterprise tier: $999/month (included)

**Setup:** $0 (zero DevOps)  
**Maintenance:** $0 (Cortex manages)

**Total Year 1:**

- Small/Medium: $6,000 ($500/mo × 12)
- Large (Enterprise): $11,988 ($999/mo × 12)

**Includes:**

- Managed graph DB
- Automatic sync
- Monitoring and scaling
- Backups and recovery
- Visualization dashboard
- Support

**Break-Even Analysis:**

For Small deployments:

- Self-hosted: ~$3,000-4,000/year
- Graph-Premium: $6,000/year
- Premium costs ~$2K-3K more, but zero DevOps

For Medium deployments:

- Self-hosted: ~$4,000-5,000/year
- Graph-Premium: $6,000/year
- Premium costs ~$1K-2K more with full management

For Large/Enterprise:

- Self-hosted becomes very complex (HA, backups, monitoring)
- Graph-Premium at $12K/year often cheaper than fully-managed self-hosted
- Plus compliance, SLA, support included

**Recommendation:** Premium makes sense for teams (time savings) and enterprise (compliance + support)

### Our Top Pick

**For 80% of users:** Start with **Memgraph for development**, move to **Neo4j Community for production**.

**Why:**

1. Memgraph: Instant Docker setup, blazing fast, great dev experience
2. Neo4j: Production-proven, huge community, same code (Cypher compatible)
3. Both use `neo4j-driver` - write once, deploy to either
4. Can switch between them with config change
5. Path to Graph-Premium later if needed

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# Development (local Docker)
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph:latest

# Production (dedicated server)
docker run -p 7687:7687 neo4j:5-community

# Same code works for both!
```

## Getting Started

### Recommended Path

**Week 1: Proof of Concept (Memgraph)**

```bash
# Start Memgraph
docker run -d -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph:latest

# Test integration
npm install neo4j-driver

# Run sync example (from Graph Integration guide)
# Verify queries work, measure performance
```

**Week 2-3: Development**

```bash
# Continue with Memgraph
# Build out sync logic
# Test all Cortex entities (contexts, facts, A2A)
# Optimize queries
```

**Week 4: Production Prep**

```bash
# Switch to Neo4j for stability
docker run -d -p 7687:7687 \
  -v neo4j-data:/data \
  neo4j:5-community

# Same sync code works!
# Add backup scripts
# Configure monitoring
```

**Month 2+: Consider Premium**

```typescript
// If spending >10 hours/month on graph DB ops
// Or need enterprise features
// Upgrade to Cortex Graph-Premium

const cortex = new Cortex({
  mode: "cloud",
  apiKey: process.env.CORTEX_CLOUD_KEY,
  graphPremium: { enabled: true },
});

// Zero DevOps, full features ✅
```

## Technical Comparison

### Query Language

**Cypher (Neo4j, Memgraph, Kùzu, Neptune OpenCypher):**

```cypher
// Easy to read and write
MATCH (a:Agent)-[:SENT_TO*1..3]-(b:Agent)
WHERE a.team = 'engineering'
RETURN b.name, count(*) as connections
ORDER BY connections DESC
```

**Gremlin (JanusGraph, Neptune Gremlin):**

```groovy
// More verbose, functional style
g.V().hasLabel('Agent').has('team', 'engineering')
 .repeat(out('SENT_TO')).times(3)
 .dedup()
 .groupCount().by('name')
 .order().by(values, desc)
```

**Recommendation:** Cypher is more intuitive and readable. Prefer Cypher-based DBs.
